# BSP viewer Phase 1

This branch starts the first `Xash3D on PS5` gate without importing game data.
The canonical Gears renderer remains intact while the BSP path is brought up as
tested, reusable interfaces.

## Gate 1 execution

1. Run `make all`; no console operation is allowed until it is green.
   `make shaders` compiles both `gears_lit.pipe` and `bsp_flat.pipe`, derives
   namespaced AGC metadata for each pipeline and emits separately named native
   stage blobs. Generated shader products remain under `build/`.
2. Bake a private map with `make bsp-bundle BSP_INPUT=/private/path/map.bsp`.
   `.bsp`, `.wad` and `.ps5bsp` files are ignored globally and are never release
   inputs. The target validates the generated file through the C runtime parser.
   A hardware-bearing artifact is built with:

   ```sh
   make bsp-native-release BSP_INPUT=/private/path/map.bsp \
     PS5LOG_DEV_CONF=/private/path/dev.conf \
     AMDLLPC=/path/to/amdllpc LLVM_READELF=/path/to/llvm-readelf
   ```

   This target refuses a missing TCP configuration, embeds the bundle SHA-256
   as generated build metadata, and copies the validated bundle only into the
   ignored `dist/PPSA99997/` title directory.
3. Upload the validated bundle into one direct-memory allocation, use the
   bundle spawn/forward fields to build the fixed view matrix, and compose the
   flat draws only after the exact command capacity has been reserved.
4. A native run must identify the artifact and bundle hashes in `ps5log/1`,
   report bundle vertex/index/draw counts, draw DWORDs, fence completion, exact
   VideoOut token, guards and teardown.
5. Record an exact raw render-target readback hash for the fixed camera. Remote
   Play supplies the accompanying visual capture, not completion evidence.

The BSP build submits the same fixed camera for 600 frames, drains GPU and
VideoOut ownership, then requires equal FNV-1a hashes over both complete tiled
render-target footprints. It also requires both buffers to contain the same
nonzero count of pixels brighter than the deliberately dark clear, proving map
geometry wrote the targets. It parks only after emitting
`BSP_GATE1_COMPLETE`; any token, guard, compose, ownership, visibility or
readback mismatch parks as an error and retains all resources.

Changes to the native command stream, direct-memory layout or indexed builder
require a soak before Gate 1 can be marked complete.

## Gate 1 hardware evidence

The independently archived run
`20260905T194257169Z_PPSA99997_ps5-agc-gears_0x2638941f043d` establishes the
fixed-camera reference on GFX1013 firmware 12.02:

- signed `eboot.bin` SHA-256:
  `ab2f4040a2d271bfa1a779500410ef6bc0b9d852c3f4bd115d94c8400c80c633`;
- private bundle SHA-256:
  `9efe388d160b0f75f7861c88bdc496a75f1b85ffa42c06acbac411527981815d`;
- 600 completed frames, zero errors and zero over-budget present intervals;
- exact VideoOut token bookends at frames 0 and 599;
- identical full-buffer FNV-1a readback `bac7777b7831038e` with 1,941,430
  bright pixels in each buffer;
- intact guards and a clean `BSP_GATE1_COMPLETE` BYE after 23 contiguous
  `ps5log/1` records.

The console title was then closed by exact identity and all development
services remained healthy. The transcript, server manifest and capture
manifest live only in the repository's ignored private evidence tree. A later
launch reused the console's existing registered Chiaki entry without pairing,
reinitializing or refocusing the stream. Its 1280x720 direct window capture has
SHA-256 `e16b7fca59fad6ba3ff1aaf75364b6288aebfd8be40fe079566c5fbc335ecebd`
and visibly shows the flat-shaded map geometry. The title was again closed by
exact identity while Chiaki remained running.

## Gate 2 noclip contract

`make bsp-noclip-native-release` preserves the fixed-camera build as a
separate reproducible mode and adds the legacy ScePad ABI only to the noclip
artifact. The left stick moves forward/back and strafes, the right stick
controls yaw/pitch, and L2/R2 descend/ascend in the baker's Y-up coordinates.
Both sticks use a 12-count deadzone and movement is normalized before applying
a 320-unit-per-second speed.

The host regression runs 10,000 deterministic camera samples and checks input
continuity, finite transforms, accumulated distance and live MVP replacement
without modifying draw colors, indices or descriptors. The native gate is
stricter than merely surviving 10,000 frames: every frame must have a connected
DualSense sample with no read error, at least 600 frames must translate, at
least 120 must look, and accumulated movement must reach 100 units. GPU and
VideoOut ownership, periodic guards, final readback and zero renderer errors
remain mandatory. No present interval may exceed the telemetry budget.
`BSP_NOCLIP_SOAK_COMPLETE` is emitted only after all of those conditions pass.

Private evidence can be checked independently without adding the transcript or
map to the publication boundary:

```sh
python3 tools/validate_bsp_noclip_evidence.py /private/run.json \
  --bundle-sha256 "$PRIVATE_BUNDLE_SHA256" --bundle-bytes "$PRIVATE_BUNDLE_BYTES"
```

The validator fails closed on identity, protocol, transcript hash and size,
sequence continuity, heartbeat cadence, exact token bookends, controller
continuity, movement thresholds, frame budget, readback, guards and clean BYE.

  `2c8d0307d5de3d0be5350c6798e7f1376c954959b72ae2ff3c74250e1b749ba4`.

The accompanying 1280x720 Remote Play capture has SHA-256
`7549bd0f83d6d19c03b808f73045a206ca01f0736c4de7f7b01cd87534c9de2a`
and shows the camera at a visibly different map position. It reused the
console's existing registered Chiaki entry; no pairing or reinitialization was
performed. The title was closed by exact identity and all development services
remained healthy.

## Gate 3 lightmap atlas contract

The baker derives each face's lightmap extents from its texture axes using the
GoldSrc 16-unit luxel grid. It validates every referenced style span before
reading the lighting lump, consumes the first style, and packs lit faces in
face order into deterministic shelves. Every rectangle receives a duplicated
one-texel gutter so later bilinear filtering cannot bleed between faces.

`LMHD` records an RGBA8 atlas no larger than 2048x2048 with an exactly
`width * 4`, 256-byte-aligned row pitch. `LMPX` contains the pixels and each
vertex carries normalized texel-centre coordinates. Unlit faces retain the
explicit `UINT32_MAX` lightmap sentinel and point at the atlas's white fallback.
The C consumer rejects incomplete chunk pairs, invalid dimensions, formats,
row pitches, draw references and UVs outside `[0, 1]` before exposing the GPU
span.

The private reference map bakes reproducibly to 2,424,944 bytes with a 512x799
atlas containing 409,088 pixels. Two independent bakes produced SHA-256
`6a44083b22545c29c787a3e136c6fedda3ced08b7ec191db365e83ab612cd0f5`.
The map and generated bundle remain ignored private inputs. This gate
establishes atlas correctness only; native sampling is introduced after the
base-texture descriptor-table contract so the final shader can bind both
resources together.

## Gate 4 base-texture descriptor-table contract

The original Phase 1 baker decoded mip level zero from each embedded GoldSrc
`miptex` and its
256-entry RGB palette. Names beginning with `{` map palette index 255 to zero
alpha. WAD-only or absent texture payloads remain renderable through a
deterministic magenta checkerboard carrying an explicit fallback flag; the
baker never opens a WAD or adds commercial input to the public tree. Malformed
directories, overlapping mip chains, palettes, dimensions and aggregate sizes
fail before a bundle is written.

Editor-only utility materials `aaatrigger`, `clip`, `hint`, `null`, `origin`
and `skip` are retained in the texture metadata but their faces are excluded
from geometry, lightmap packing and draw emission. GoldSrc uses them to mark
invisible trigger, collision and compiler volumes; drawing them would expose
their deliberately conspicuous 16x16 editor artwork in the game world.

Bundle ABI version 2 used one 32-byte `TEXM` image entry per original texture
and `TEXP` stored
the corresponding RGBA8 rows. Every image begins at a 256-byte boundary and
every row pitch is a multiple of 256 bytes. Images remain separate rather than
being packed into an atlas, preserving GoldSrc's repeated base UVs. The C
consumer proves all spans, formats, pitches, flags, ordering and draw indices
before exposing them.

`bsp_texture_descriptor` then emits the exact 8-DWORD GFX10.3 linear image SRD
and 4-DWORD sampler SRD. Each 24-DWORD table contains binding 0 with repeat and
bilinear filtering for the base image, followed by binding 1 with clamp-to-last-
texel and bilinear filtering for the shared lightmap. The builder checks 48-bit
256-byte-aligned GPU addresses, GFX1013 dimensions and custom row pitch, sizes
the complete table before writing, and rejects forged bundle views. Generated
AMD headers are not published; the field positions are the narrow independently
reviewable subset of Mesa's MIT-licensed `ac_descriptors.c` and
`gfx10-rsrc.json` definitions.

At the Phase 1 checkpoint the private reference map baked reproducibly to
7,056,384 bytes with 164
base textures occupying 4,780,032 pitched bytes and requiring 3,936 descriptor
DWORDs. Its 84 `aaatrigger` faces are omitted, leaving 16,893 vertices, 29,013
indices and 3,611 map draws. Two independent bakes produced SHA-256
`ef9661dbfaad03bcefef4e07707ebc21cc8a13812a7e63bc8e58a408ae8ab42b`.
This gate establishes base-image decoding and descriptor-table construction;
the next gate consumes those tables in the native `base * lightmap` pipeline
and carries the changed command stream through the 60,000-frame soak.

Phase 3 supersedes this one-level storage contract with bundle ABI version 3:
each image record carries a deterministic complete mip count and `TEXP` stores
the chain in GFX10 linear smallest-to-base order with 256-byte row pitches.
The historical Phase 1 hashes above remain evidence for the version-2 gate.

## Gate 5 base x lightmap native contract

`make bsp-textured-native-release` is a distinct fail-closed build mode layered
on the validated noclip artifact. It compiles and embeds the project-authored
`bsp_textured.pipe` GFX1013 stages, requires both the private bundle and TCP
telemetry configuration, and retains the fixed-camera and 10,000-frame targets
as independently reproducible modes.

The vertex stage consumes the baker's 32-byte position/base-UV/light-UV record.
The pixel stage binds one 24-DWORD table per draw: binding 0 samples the repeated
base image and binding 1 samples the clamped shared lightmap, both bilinearly,
then writes `base.rgb * lightmap.rgb`. Palette-alpha texels below 0.5 are
discarded. The synthetic clear draw uses an explicit control word and never
samples map data.

Bundle version 2 stores `INDX` as little-endian uint16 values and rejects maps
whose emitted vertex count exceeds 65,536. `DRAW_INDEX_2` carries an address
and count but not an index-width field; the preceding GFX10.3 command state is
therefore matched explicitly by the compact index representation. Version 1's
uint32 stream could be consumed as alternating `index, 0` uint16 values and
visually produced long triangles converging on vertex zero even while command,
fence and VideoOut telemetry remained valid.

Each draw is exactly 32 command DWORDs: a 23-DWORD pre-raster parameter packet,
a three-DWORD pixel descriptor-table-pointer packet and a six-DWORD indexed
draw. Composition prevalidates every table and index span before writing the
first command. Runtime planning reserves the complete aligned descriptor area,
one immutable binding pointer per scene draw, command slots sized from that
32-DWORD stride, and a trailing guard.

The hardware gate requires 60,000 completed frames and connected DualSense
samples. Movement thresholds are not repeated here: Gate 2 already proves the
same noclip and ScePad path with 2,018 translating frames, 678 looking frames
and a clean 10,000-frame completion. Gate 5 instead isolates the changed
textured command stream. It requires exact VideoOut token bookends, zero
renderer, pad and present-budget errors, intact guards, visible pixels in both
final render targets, matching texture/descriptor cardinality and a clean
`bsp-textured-soak-complete` BYE. Motion counters remain monotonic telemetry and
the validator checks that completion matches the final input heartbeat, but
their values may be zero during an unattended graphics soak.

Private evidence is checked with:

```sh
python3 tools/validate_bsp_textured_evidence.py /private/run.json \
  --bundle-sha256 "$PRIVATE_BUNDLE_SHA256" --bundle-bytes "$PRIVATE_BUNDLE_BYTES"
```

The validator independently checks transcript integrity, identity, boot token,
all 100 controller heartbeats, 60,000-frame terminal telemetry, descriptor and
sampler contract, readback visibility and clean structured shutdown. Hardware
results and the Remote Play capture are recorded only after the signed artifact
passes that validator.

## Gate 5 hardware evidence

The independently archived run
`20260906T104934442Z_PPSA99997_ps5-agc-gears_0x57b1c21d2219` passed on GFX1013

  `091707cbcf4b3fe31c0bb9a7134dfddeb6de14c23ffcb06d428f412e7a2ed3eb`.

The final direct-window capture remains in the ignored private evidence tree
and has SHA-256
`eb4d32fc9b55a4313e8ea9d90f7505528a2665b4b58adf42295ca699e7bed11e`.
It visibly shows the textured and lightmapped reference corridor with
editor-only `aaatrigger` surfaces omitted. The console title was then closed by
exact identity; Chiaki and all development services remained running.

### Remote Play / DualSense handoff

On the reference Ubuntu/PS5 setup, Chiaki owns interactive input while its
Remote Play session is open and maps the workstation keyboard to the console.
Taking the physical DualSense to play directly on the PS5 disconnects the
Remote Play session and transfers control to the console.

At the time of this Phase 1 gate, the ended stream was closed manually through
Chiaki's `Session has quit` dialog. That is historical procedure, not the
current lab contract. The canonical helper now launches the already registered
console directly through Chiaki's CLI and `stop-stream` terminates only the
exact verified CLI-owned PID. Normal restart does not require the discovery
window, pairing, focus changes or a synthetic `OK` click.

Gate 2 uses this handoff to prove physical-controller movement. Gate 5 does not
repeat it: inspect or capture the textured frame through the stream and leave
the connected pad neutral while `ps5log/1` judges the unattended graphics
soak. If the operator does take over physically, use the lab's `stop-stream`
command before restarting the CLI stream. This workflow never pairs,
re-registers or synthesizes input.
