# Release process

## One production runtime

The default native build is the user-facing playable release profile:

```sh
export XASH_GAME_DATA=/absolute/path/to/half-life
AMDLLPC=/path/to/amdllpc LLVM_READELF=/path/to/llvm-readelf \
  make native-release
```

The package boots MainUI, where the player chooses New Game or Load Game. The
renderer runs continuously through the PS5 AGC path, while logs and structured
telemetry are written beside save/config data. The user closes the title with
the PS5 **Close Game** action.

An external Close Game terminates the process through the system lifecycle, so
the TCP transcript normally ends without application BYE. That is expected for
operator closure. Automated soaks use this same artifact: the PC supervisor
observes continuous frame/ownership/guard telemetry, records its target and
closes the exact title when the target is reached. Host tests exercise bounded
sequences by calling the same state machine's `drain` operation directly; no
second runner or frame-limit API exists.

## Candidate archive

After a release-mode native build:

```sh
bash tools/package_release.sh v0.1.0-rc1
```

The deterministic archive contains the title folder, license, notices and
per-file checksums. It intentionally excludes `dev.conf`, logs, captures,
compiler output and development paths. Before distribution, run `make all`,
verify the archive hash from a clean checkout and attach it only alongside the
matching source revision.

## Current pre-publication gates

- Host C and Python contracts pass with warnings as errors.
- Publication audit passes from a generated working tree.
- Native foundation and shader target are pinned.
- Signed SELF integrity is inspected during every native build.
- The exact release artifact must receive a hardware launch/telemetry check
  before tagging; soak duration is controlled externally.
- Repository visibility and final distributable identity remain explicit owner
  decisions; no script publishes or pushes automatically.

Development experiments follow `DEVELOPMENT.md`: a sibling Git worktree and
short-lived `exp/<topic>` branch replace historical copied `stage-*` trees.
